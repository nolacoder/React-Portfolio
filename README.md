# React Portfolio

## Description

React is a cutting edge technology that combines HTML with Javascript to allow for quick page rendering using modular code in the form of components. In order to show off my knowledge , I have created my portfolio using React. This portfolio showcases information about me, my portfolio, a form where you can enter contact information, and a resume page. Take a look around the app to get to know me and see some of my work!
